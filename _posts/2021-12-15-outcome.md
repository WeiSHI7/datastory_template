This post records all the confusion matrixes and ROC-AUC curves we collected testing six datasets with the distlBERT model.
Also with the additional explanations.

#### Ethnic Group:

![all_ethnic](../plots/all_ethnic.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

As mentioned in the home page, the **Gujarati people** and **Italian Argentines** get the highest true positive rate and accuracy. While **African Americans** has the most samples.

#### Date of Birth

![all_date](../plots/all_date.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Quotations of the people born in **1990s** gets the highest true positive rate and accuracy. Also, as shown in the **7th row** of the Matrix, most of people born in **1980s** are indentified as 1990s.

#### Religion

![all_religion](../plots/all_religion.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The speakers in **Hinduism** get the highest true positive rate and accuracy, and also the most number of samples in the dataset. Then follows **Presbyterianism** and **Islam** . It seems for the ```Religion``` feature, the performance of our model has positive correlation with the number of the samples.

#### Gender

#### Occupation

#### Nationality
